        <h1 style="text-align:center">Computer Languages</h1>
       
        <p>So what are <strong>Computer Languages</strong>? As you might know, Computer does not understand our languages,like English, Latin, Hindi,Bengali,etc. But it needs a way to communicate with us some how, right? So, since it is a machine it undeerstands <strong><em>only '0'and '1'</em></strong>. Thus, whenever we say or command something it is easier if we write it in the form of 0 and 1. But as it might seem it is quite difficult, isn't it? So some genius minds devised a plan that we will command it with specific words or letters which carries a special meaning to the computer."But it does not understand our language!?", I hear you scream, well who created the commands devised a solution that the computer will have a  <strong><em>Translator</em></strong> of its own, which will convert it into 0s and 1s. so this language of <strong><em>0s and 1s</em></strong> is called <strong><em>BINARY LANGUAGE</em></strong>. The translator is of two types <strong><em>Compiler and Interpreter</em></strong>.These are same but with with different approaches. The compiler converts all the commands (or, entire  <em>program</em>) into Binary, while the Interpreter converts each command individually.
